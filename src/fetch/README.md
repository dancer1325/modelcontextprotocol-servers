# Fetch MCP Server

* MCP server /
  * provides 
    * web content fetching capabilities
      * ⚠️POSSIBLE security risk ⚠️
        * Reason: 🧠can access local/internal IP addresses🧠
          * -> ⚠️can expose sensitive data⚠️
      * ⚠️web page content got is truncated⚠️
        * if you want to specify the content start extraction -> use the `start_index` argument
        * 
  * enables
    * LLMs can
      * retrieve & process content
        * -- from -- web pages
        * in chunks
      * convert web HTML content -- to -- markdown
        * -> easier consumption 

### Available Tools

- `fetch` - Fetches a URL from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.
  - `url` (string, required)
    - == URL -- to -- fetch
  - `max_length` (integer, optional):
    - Maximum number of characters / return
      - by default, 5000
  - `start_index` (integer, optional)
    - Start content -- from -- this character index
      - by default, 0
  - `raw` (boolean, optional)
    - Get raw content / NO markdown conversion
      - by default, false

### Prompts

- **fetch**
  - fetch a URL
  - extract URL contents -- as -- markdown
  - Arguments:
    - `url` (string, required)
      - URL to fetch

## Installation

* TODO: Optionally: Install node.js, this will cause the fetch server to use a different HTML simplifier that is more robust.

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed
* We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *mcp-server-fetch*.

### Using PIP

Alternatively you can install `mcp-server-fetch` via pip:

```
pip install mcp-server-fetch
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m mcp_server_fetch
```

## Configuration

### Configure for Claude.app

Add to your Claude settings:

### Configure for VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons below...

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code
* You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace
* This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is needed when using the `mcp.json` file.

<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "fetch": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using Docker</summary>

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "fetch": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/fetch"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### Customization - robots.txt

By default, the server will obey a websites robots.txt file if the request came from the model (via a tool), but not if
the request was user initiated (via a prompt)
* This can be disabled by adding the argument `--ignore-robots-txt` to the
`args` list in the configuration.

### Customization - User-agent

By default, depending on if the request came from the model (via a tool), or was user initiated (via a prompt), the
server will use either the user-agent
```
ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (Autonomous; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
```
or
```
ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (User-Specified; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
```

This can be customized by adding the argument `--user-agent=YourUserAgent` to the `args` list in the configuration.

### Customization - Proxy

The server can be configured to use a proxy by using the `--proxy-url` argument.

## Windows Configuration

If you're experiencing timeout issues on Windows, you may need to set the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to ensure proper character encoding:

<details>
<summary>Windows configuration (uvx)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows configuration (pip)</summary>

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_fetch"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

This addresses character encoding issues that can cause the server to timeout on Windows systems.

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server
* For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-fetch
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/fetch
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-fetch
```
